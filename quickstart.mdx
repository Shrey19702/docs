Welcome to the AI Content Detection API! This guide will walk you through the essential steps to make your first analysis request.

## 1. Get Your API Key
Before you can make any requests, you'll need an API key. You can generate a key from your user dashboard.

All API requests must be authenticated by including your key as a Bearer token in the `Authorization` header.

```bash
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY
```
Keep your key secure. Requests without a valid key will be rejected.

## 2. Choose Your Analysis Type
You have two options when analyzing your media files with the API. 
If you want a quick check, the `basic analysis` returns results immediately. 
If you need more detail, the `advanced analysis` provides a thorough analysis, including metadata and visual insights.

<CardGroup>
    <Card title="Basic Analysis">
        **Use Case:** Best for quick, single-file checks or when you need an immediate response.

        **How it works:** You send one or more files, and the API responds directly with the analysis results in the same request.

        **Endpoint:** `/basic_analysis`
    </Card>
    <Card title="Advanced Analysis">
        **Use Case:** Ideal for in-depth analysis where more detailed results are required.

        **How it works:** You send one or more files, and the API performs a deeper analysis using more powerful models. It returns detailed results directly in the response, including heatmaps, watermark checks, and file metadata analysis.

        **Endpoint:** `/advance_analysis`
    </Card>

## 3. Make Your First Request (Basic Analysis)

Hereâ€™s a curl example of how to send an image file for a basic analysis. The `filenames` parameter is required and must correspond to the files you upload.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Step 1: Set API Key
    # Save your API key to an environment variable for convenience
    export VISION_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    ```bash Step 2: Run Command
    # Replace path/to/your/image.jpg with the actual file path
    curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/v1/basic_analysis" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $VISION_API_KEY" \
    -F "files=@path/to/your/image.jpg" \
    -F "filenames=image_01.jpg" \
    -F "metadata={\"userId\": \"user-123\", \"source\": \"web-upload\"}"
    ```
</CodeGroup>

The API responds with a JSON object containing results. Each file is analyzed for AI-generated content, and relevant metadata is included.

## 4. Making an Advanced Analysis Request
Advanced analysis uses the same request structure but returns a more detailed response.

<CodeGroup>
    ```bash Step 1: Set API Key
    # Make sure your API key is set in an environment variable
    export VISION_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
    ```
    ```bash Step 2: Run Command
    # Replace path/to/your/image.png with the actual file path
    curl -X POST "https://api.example.com/v1/advance_analysis" \
    -H "Authorization: Bearer $VISION_API_KEY" \
    -F "files=@path/to/your/image.png" \
    -F "filenames=evidence_photo.png" \
    -F "concern=Please run a full check on this image for a news report."
    ```
</CodeGroup>
The response includes:
- Visual heatmaps highlighting regions flagged as AI-generated
- Watermark detection results
- Detailed metadata for each file


Use advanced analysis when you need in-depth examination or file-level metadata for multiple checks.
